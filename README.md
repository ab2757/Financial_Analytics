    2. Testing Multi-collinearity
    3. Heteroscedasticity
    4. Autocorrelation of error terms


## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ab2757/ABDS2019/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression)
* Classification techniques & business problems
* Intro to Logistic Regression models
    1. Why Logistic vs. Linear models
    2. Odds Ratio

* Applications of Logistic regression models ( Theory )
    1. Up Sell/Cross Sell
    2. Credit Risk

#### Case Study – Help client identify customers whom they can cross sell their banking products and devise a strategy to ensure high conversion.

* Generalized Linear models using Python
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for Visualization
* Shortlist the significant variables
* Test vs. Train data sets 
* Validation of the model – Confusion matrix
* Accuracy / Recall / Precision
* Evaluate the model & give business recommendations.

#### Practice case study: Credit Risk – Identify the customers with high risk of default and give the required recommendation on the model output.

## [Time Series](https://github.com/ab2757/ABDS2019/tree/master/cash%20flow%20forecasting)
* Introduction
* Applications&banking industry examples
* Components of time series
    1. Use EXCEL to understand the time series graph and practice using timeseries data.
* Algorithms
    1. Simple Average
    2. Weighted Moving Average
    3. Exponential Moving Average
    4. MAPE and RMSE
* Use Python to learn complex time-series solutions :
    1. Intro to other time series techniques – ARIMA, ARIMAX models

#### Case Study – 
As a financial expert, you are given the actual cash requirements for a company for last few years. Analyse the various components of time series and predict the cash flow for next quarter.
* Code
* Interpretation
* Final o/p


## [Segmentation](https://github.com/ab2757/ABDS2019/tree/master/Segmentation)
1. K-Means

#### Case Study - Cluster the given set of customer base to help in segmentationand identify different ways of digitalization for each customers.
* Standardize the data
* Run the k-means segmentation on data using Python
* Identify the best number of clusters
* Comment on the final clusters

1. Decision Tress
* What is Decision Tree
* Applications & advantages
* Understanding algorithm – Gini / Variance reduction
* Intro to CART

#### Case Study – Analyse the data for churn and understand the reason of Churn with help of decision tree.

* What is Churn?
* Soft vs. Hard churn
* Run Decision tree using Python
* Plot the tree
* Analyse the nodes

Analyse the tree output and give top rules to understand the hard churn of customers


2. Random Forest
* What is Bagging  and Boosting
* Random Forest algorithms
* Hyper parameters in Random Forest

#### Case Study - Predict soft churn e.g. identify the customers whose transaction will drop in upcoming time. Take pro-active measures to ensure loss of revenue.

* Understand model outputs
* Extract top decile and recommend next steps
